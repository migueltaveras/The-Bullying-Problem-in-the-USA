<p>Bullying is a big problem in the United States of America. Bullying can cause damage to any kid, any age, and its a subject mainstream media does not talk about enough. It is important we, as a society, protect our youth! In a world that lacks Role Models and many households lack a father figure, especially in the black and latino communities, I Miguel Taveras, want to change the world! and how we handle Bullying in our school systems and even in the workplace! Because I, Miguel Taveras, was bullied as a youth!</p></center>

<p>Now I am no counselor or doctor, but as a victim of bullying i can speak of my own experiences. Being bullied is not easy and i pray my nieces and nephews, or my future children, do not go through what i endured. Many kids pick on other kids for many reasons, either they lack guidance at home or come from a broken home with no father figure or mother figure to discipline them. Another reason for a person or child to bully someone is because they are taking their anger out on society, instead of talking to a professional counselor or therapist! Also, many bullies suffer from self esteem issues and bullying other people makes them feel better. I blame the school system for not providing enough resources to keep our kids off these streets and teaching important topics like why bullying shouldn't be tolerated in our society!</p></center>

<h1>Dear America</h1>
<p>Bullying is a major problem affecting the youth, Its time we as a society try to put a stop to bullying. Schools should have a class or training program on this topic. Every child who is caught bullying someone should be required to go to therapy and/or counseling. Because many of the Bullies in society are taking their anger out on society and if they continue to be violent and aggressive when they reach adulthood, it can lead to them hurting more people or getting themselves hurt or even worse, going to jail for violence!</p>
